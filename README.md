## Architecrure
After starting the project with `docker-compose up`, the following components are available:

### **Frontend (Nginx)**
- **URL**: `http://localhost:8080`
- **Features**:
    - Input a valid URL string in the text field.
    - Input validation (only URLs starting with `http://` or `https://` are accepted).
    - Submit the URL along with a randomly generated `clientid` to the Flask backend endpoint.
    - Real-time display of messages received via RabbitMQ in the frontend.

### **Flask Backend**
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5000/health`
- **Features**:
    - Accepts POST requests with `clientid` and `url`.
    - Forwards the data to RabbitMQ.

### **RabbitMQ**
- **Management GUI**: `http://localhost:15672` (Username: `admin`, Password: `admin` (for now, will be outsourced to ENV variables in the future))
- **Queue**: `health_queue`
- **Function**: Stores and forwards messages to the Socket.IO server.

### **Socket.IO Server**
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Function**:
    - Receives messages from RabbitMQ.
    - NYI: Calls Lighthouse CLI to audit the URL.
    - NYI: Calls AI model to generate insights.
    - NYI: Sends insights back to client
    - Routes messages based on `clientid` to the appropriate client only.
